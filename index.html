            <h3 class="title">Autobiography</h3>
            <p id="autobiography">My current permanent address is in the town of Calauag, Quezon Province. It's quite distant from the university; approximately 8 hours to travel from here to there. A part of the reason why I pursued computer science as a course is because it is what NCAE predicted me to be. At first, I was interested in pursuing electronics engineering, and later on, I decided to follow computer science, since UPLB offers more potential opportunities in life overall. As of now I have taken the course on software engineering, so I have knowledge on how the MERN stack works. As of now I'm still learning and exploring other things within the field of computer science; I still do not have sufficient confidence to say which aspects are those until I successfully present a satisfactory project related to it.</p>
